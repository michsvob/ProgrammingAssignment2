#demonstration of lexical scoping in R
#when you make the matrix, an inverse matrix is also made at the same time
#and this one can be later retrieved by the other function instead of 
#calculating again. That's how I understood it.

#make an matrix object, that also has stored value of inverse matrix

  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL

  getinverse <- function() m
